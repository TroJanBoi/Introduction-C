# While Loop Exercises in C

1. **Sum of Positive Numbers**  
   Write a C program that reads integers from the user and uses a `while` loop to calculate the sum of all positive numbers. The program should stop reading input when the user enters `0`.  
   - **Input:** A sequence of integers (terminating with `0`).  
   - **Output:** The sum of all positive integers entered.

2. **Factorial Calculator**  
   Write a C program that asks the user for a non-negative integer `n` and uses a `while` loop to compute `n!` (n factorial).  
   - **Input:** A single non-negative integer `n`.  
   - **Output:** The factorial of `n`.

3. **Digit Counter**  
   Write a C program that reads a positive integer from the user and uses a `while` loop to count how many digits the number has.  
   - **Input:** A positive integer.  
   - **Output:** The number of digits in the integer.

4. **Fibonacci Sequence**  
   Write a C program that asks the user for a positive integer `N` and uses a `while` loop to print the first `N` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.  
   - **Input:** A positive integer `N`.  
   - **Output:** The first `N` Fibonacci numbers, separated by spaces.

5. **Reverse an Integer**  
   Write a C program that reads an integer from the user and uses a `while` loop to reverse its digits.  
   - **Input:** An integer (e.g., `12345`).  
   - **Output:** The integer with its digits reversed (e.g., `54321`).
