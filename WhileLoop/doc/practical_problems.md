# Simple While Loop Exercises in C

1. **Print Numbers 1 to 10**  
   Write a program that uses a `while` loop to print the numbers from 1 through 10, each on its own line.

2. **Print Even Numbers up to 20**  
   Use a `while` loop to print all even numbers between 2 and 20 inclusive.

3. **Sum from 1 to N**  
   Ask the user to enter a positive integer `N`. Then use a `while` loop to calculate and print the sum of all integers from 1 to `N`.

4. **Countdown from N to 1**  
   Read a positive integer `N` from the user, then use a `while` loop to print the numbers from `N` down to 1.

5. **First N Multiples of 3**  
   Prompt the user for a positive integer `N`. Use a `while` loop to print the first `N` multiples of 3 (i.e., 3, 6, 9, ...).
